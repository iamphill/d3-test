# D3.js

I've always looked at D3.js and thought 'whoah! That is crazy!' but never actually looked into the power of it!

So this is what this is, a way for me to mess around with D3.js to create crazy stuff!

## Examples

The following examples are in the repo:

### [Hexagons](hexagaon.html)

Creates rows & columns of hexagons to fill the width and height of the containing element. The colours are auto-generated. Hovering over a hexagon changes to colour to be darker (also auto-generated) and scales the hexagon.
